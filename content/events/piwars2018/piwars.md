PiWars is an annual amateur robotics competition run by Mike Horne (@recantha)
and Tim Richardson (@Geeky_Tim). The competition has Raspberry Pi-
powered robots competing in a number of non-destructive autonomous and
remote-control challenges, with varying criteria for points and prizes.

PiWars first ran in TODO: XXX, and TODO: XXX of the YYY teams included Makespace
members. Since then, Makespace members have competed (and won!) every year.
This year was no exception, with TODO: XXX of the YYY teams entered having at
least one Makespace member.

Perhaps the most successful is Brian Corteil of Coretec Robotics, who won the
2017 and 2016 competitions overall, and this year took home second place in the
"professionals" category, and first place for Technical Merit.

This year's challenges had four autonomous challenges:
 * "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" - Use a camera (or otherwise) identify coloured
   balls in the corners of a square arena, and visit their corners in the
   correct order.
 * "Minimal Maze" - Navigate a simple single-path maze, the layout of which is
   known ahead of time. Harder than it sounds!
 * "Straight Line Speed Test" - Race down a straight, 7 metre course as quickly
   as possible, without touching the walls.
 * "Slightly deranged golf" - Get the golf ball around the course and into the
   hole, careful of the windmill!

There were also two remote-controlled challenges, comprising:
 * "Obstacle Course" - A complicated series of various obstacles, not known
   until the day, which must be navigated in the shortest time possible.
 * "Duck Shoot" - Rolling balls or firing projectiles, knock down as many
   duck-shaped targets as possible, in three five-shot salvos.

And in a category all of its own, the only adversarial challenge:
 * "Pi Noon" - A tournament-structured event, which pits robots head-to-head
   (under remote control). Each robot has three balloons attached, along with
   a pin on a lance. last balloon standing wins!

Apart from the "active" events, points and prizes are also awarded for technical
merit, blogging, aesthetics and other rather more esoteric metrics.

One notable entry (from a Makespace member, no less) was Mark Mellors'
"_Piradigm_" - an audacious attempt to enter every single event in autonomouse
mode, using nothing but a Pi camera for input. I think it's fair to say that it
performed better in practice runs before the event, but Mark won a Special Award
for his efforts. Perhaps most impressive was _Piradigm_'s success in beating a
human driver in the "Pi Noon" event.

Mike and Tim have not yet confirmed if the event will run next year. However,
for anyone interested in getting involved, Brian Corteil has started running
robotics workshops in Makespace every TODO: XXX, where budding roboteers can get
help, advice, and show off their wares (PiWars entry not required!).
