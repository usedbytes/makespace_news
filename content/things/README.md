# Things

In each newsletter, we will publish a "name that thing". Examples might be:

 * A random piece of detritus from the trove
 * A half-finished 3D print
 * A collection of laser-cut bits

We could try and do prizes, perhaps different categories, like "correct",
"funniest", "most outlandish" - as chosen by ???
