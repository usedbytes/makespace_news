# Issues

Each subdirectory in issues represents a newsletter issue.

TODO: How are issues constructed? symlinks work well for linux, but no-one uses
linux.

The issue should consist of a short header, some common "brief" items (e.g.
events in meetup this month), and then one entry from each category.

**One entry from each category could be a huge amount of content. Might be
better to have one/two categories which are regular, and then rotate the others
as content becomes available **
